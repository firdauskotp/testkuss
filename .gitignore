# Tailwind CSS
# No specific build artifacts to ignore other than node_modules,
# as output.css is a generated asset that should be tracked by git
# if not using a build server to generate it on the fly.
# However, if you were using a more complex build setup (e.g. with Parcel, Webpack),
# you might have a /dist or /build folder to ignore.
